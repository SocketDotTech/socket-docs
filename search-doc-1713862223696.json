Anyone can build a switchboard that satisfies the ISwitchboard interface. It needs to be registered to Socket before Plugs can use it via the registerSwitchboard() method on Socket. Registering a Switchboard is completely permissionless. Socket Labs has bootstrapped some switchboards with different tradeoffs for end developers, we encourage developers to feel free to leverage these switchboards if they are suitable for their usecase. Optimistic Switchboard: Allow 1/N trust-minimised and cheap validation by introducing a challenge mechanism pre-execution where N parties can stop the packet from getting executed. This Switchboard will be extremely cheap to leverage but will have a latency of the challenge period. Fast Switchboard: Allow 1/N trust minimised validation by having all N parties attest on-chain, this is still as secure as the OptimisticSwitchboard but might cost more on-chain depending on the destination chain.Native Switchboard: Allows developers to leverage native verification for eg: rollup-validation wherever it's available, we have built these connectors for Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism right now. Developers who want to leverage security of the native-security should leverage these.

We think for something as critical as AMB's nothing should be assumed or taken for-granted. We think these new terms are accurate and will encourage people to look into the docs/code and discourage assumptions. Here is a quick run-down of some of the terms that you will come across the entire documentation: Socket: Socket is the core contract deployed on all networks that are supported. All core modules and functions exist within SocketPlug/Plugs: Plugs are smart contract applications that connect with Socket to send and receive cross-chain messages via the IPlug interface. Plugs are generally adapter contracts that connect your main Smart contract to the messaging infrastructure.Message: Message is the payload you want to transmit along with relevant meta-data like destination chainSlug etc. Packet: Packets are a collection of messages sent from one chain to another. The validity of messages in a packet is verified on the destination chain based on the logic prescribed in the configured switchboard. Read more.Sealed Packet: As soon as the transmitter seals the packet on the source-chain with their signature it's called &quot;SealedPacket&quot;. Read more about how transmitters work here. Capacitor: Capacitor is responsible for storing messages in the form of a Packet. The packet is released when the transmitter calls the sealPacket method on the capacitor. Capacitors allow for native batching of payloads for better gas-performance. Read more.Switchboard: Switchboards are the authentication/verification modules that allow developers to have custom verification for their payloads/messages. They can be permissionlessly built and deployed by the community. Read moreTransmitter: Transmitters are the entities responsible for transmission of Packet across layers, their activity is completely on-chain and managed by TransmitManager.

The only 2 cross-chain agents that are part of Socket Protocol are the following: Transmitters: Transmitters are the agents that are responsible for sealing packets on the source chain to finalise them and propose them on the destination chain. They are only responsible for liveliness of the system, the protocol design makes sure they can't censor packets as sealing can only be done sequentially and once a packet is sealed anyone can propose the sealed packet on the destination chain.Executors: Executors are workers that execute the messages from the Packet on the destination chain by calling the inbound function on the Plugs. Apart from the above there are no native off-chain agents to Socket protocol.

We have clear roles on the contract and plans on how to remove them. All roles are listed in the AccessRoles.sol contract Here are some of the roles and the purpose: RESCUE_ROLE: It's only used to rescue funds if stuck in a contract which isnt supposed to hold funds. This is just a safety role to allow us to give back people their ERC20s or ETHER that they might have accidentally sent.WITHDRAW_ROLE: We haven't built a permissionless way to execute fee distribution via TransmitManager, ExecutionManager and Switchboard yet, hence we have this special role to allow us to withdraw and distribute the fees. This role will deprecate once the fee distribution logic is on-chain. This does not impact the security implications for the end user and only affects the off-chain agents.EXECUTOR_ROLE: This role whitelists addresses to allow them to execute messages post permissionless validation by the switchboard. This role is currently permissioned to prevent users from harmful effects of REV. This role holds no security implications.TRANSMITTER_ROLE: This role is not part of Socket protocol. This role is used by TransmitManager to grant approval to a particular transmitter to seal and propose packets. TransmitterManager is a modular contract. GOVERNANCE_ROLE: This one is an interesting one. The role is minimally used by intention. This role CANNOT UPDATE the security properties of a message and or modify user preferences. This role is minimally used in the core-contracts to update the TransmitManager and ExecutionManager modules, both of which cannot harm the end developer and in the worst case just pause the protocol as the current TransmitManager and ExecutionManager modules are implemented. Apart from the core-contracts, the GOVERNANCE_ROLE can be utilised with a different setting in the switchboards but switchboards are permissionless already and developers can remove or update the usage of the role according to their preferences.TRIP_ROLE: This role allows holder to trip or pause a Switchboard, in case of smart contract bugs on a specific SwitchboardUN_TRIP_ROLE: This role allows holder to untrip or unpause a SwitchboardWATCHER_ROLE: Role assigned to Switchboard watchers. Watchers play different a different role depending on the Switchboard used.

When a payload is sent by a contract to Socket deployed locally on that chain, Socket compresses it into a Packet - a cryptographic hash representing 1000s of payloads that want to be sent to another chain. Packet delivery is carried out by off-chain participants called &quot;Transmitters&quot;. Much like a sequencer in an L2, the transmitter is responsible for delivering a bunch of payloads from one-chain to another. However, an important difference is, Transmitter first signs and seals a packet on the source side and then submits the packet on the destination side. The packet, along with the transmitter’s signature, is now available on Socket on both chains On the destination chain, contracts called Switchboards allow protocols to select context around how &amp; when a delivered payload should be processed. Socket appoints executors to process the message payload only if it meets conditions on the protocol selected Switchboard. For example, accept payload after timeout of 2 hours, accept payload if native bridge confirms etc. There are several components in the Socket protocol that work together to make the above happen.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Architecture​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Protocol Design","url":"/Learn/protocol-design#architecture","content":"Socket is built in a modular fashion with various layers with defined APIs/Interfaces between them which allows developers the ability to leverage the software-stack in different and more efficient ways depending on their application context. The protocol consists of four key layers: Application Layer: This layer consists of Plugs, which are smart contract applications built to interact with Socket. Plugs follow a specified API and communicate through deployed Socket instances between any two supported chains. The core Socket contract functions as an on-chain endpoint that sends and receives payloads between chains. As applications send payloads through Plugs, Socket compresses them into cryptographic hashes called Packets, which represent thousands of payloads across apps.Delivery Layer: The delivery layer handles message batching and packet delivery between chains. Capacitor contracts in Socket store packets until they are ready to be sealed. Transmitters, off-chain actors deliver packets between chains by committing with their signatures on both source and destination chains. This ensures transparency and accountability. The verification layer can use this to build trustless verification schemes. Permissionless and transparent message delivery allows for an efficient marketplace for message delivery.Verification Layer: The layer for packet and message verification through Switchboards. These customizable verification modules allow developers to define custom conditions for packet acceptance or rejection, offering flexibility in terms of security and performance. On the destination chain, contracts called Switchboards enable apps to choose the context in which a delivered payload is processed. Socket processes the payload only if it meets the conditions specified by the app-selected Switchboard, such as accepting payloads after a 2-hour timeout or confirming payloads through a native rollup bridge. Permissionlessness and modularity at the verification layer is a core advantage and design principle for Socket. Execution Layer: This layer handles message execution on the destination chain after verification, allowing third-party relayers like Gelato to handle execution, or for applications or users to execute their own messages with various re-try mechanisms etc.  Learn more about individual components in Components and Offchain Agents.

Plugs connect to sibling plugs deployed on other chains by sending configuration details such as sibling chain ID, sibling plug address and switchboard configuration. Upon connection, Socket generates a unique identifier for the configuration and stores it. It then emits an event PlugConnected with the config data. Here's an example transaction. General Notes :​ Plugs may use different switchboards depending on their usecases and security requirements. They can even build a custom switchboard.Plugs can only connect to one plug on each sibling chain.

They do this by passing a message payload that has the state changes encoded, which destination plugs decode and execute.  To pass a message, Plugs call the outbound method on Socket with fees, siblingChainSlug, msgGasLimit, payload, transmitterParams, executorParams. Socket checks the stored configuration of the plug and verifies a connection with the sibling chain was previously instantiated. It then deducts the fee sent from the plug and pays to various off-chain actors. Plugs need to pay a fee to off-chain actors to get messages included in a packet to be executed on the destination chain. More on Fees here. Socket encodes key parameters into a message and hashes the encoded data. It then calls the capacitor and stores the hashed message in the capacitor. This emits a MessageAdded event. The message is stored in the capacitor until it can be emitted. Capacitors are chain specific and all messages to be sent to respective destination chains get aggregated in a given capacitor. Periodically, Off-chain transmitters will call seal() method on the capacitor which seals all stored messages into a packet and emits a Sealed event for the packet. This event is then picked up by transmitters that propose this packet on the destination chain.

This includes the packetId, root, switchboard &amp; signature. Sending the signature separately allows the transmitter to sign messages from an authorized address, but be relayed by anyone. The transmitter proposes the packet for specified Switchboard and a packetCount is assigned to this proposal. If the address proposing the packet is a valid transmitter, the packet proposal is successful. The packet is stored in a mapping packetIdRoots and a PacketProposed event is emitted.  Once a packet is proposed, depending on the Switchboard used, the packet's validity is verified by watchers. More on this here. Once the packet is verified, executors then call execute on a message. During the execution of the message, the following is checked : The message is included in a packet (Decapacitor)The packet has been verified by the switchboard and exists on the source chain (Switchboard)  If these are verified, then the message can be executed. Executors call the execute() method on Socket which checks if the above cases are verified and calls the inbound method on the destination plug. It passes the designated payload to the Plug, which can be arbitrarily executed. In case the message cannot be executed due to insufficient gas limit or other errors, Socket will re-try execution periodically. More in Execution Failure. ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"}]
