**Transmitters** are off-chain smart agents responsible for moving user requests and **Watcher-generated proofs** from off-chain to onchain. They coordinate with **Watchers** to submit the necessary data to the onchain **SOCKET contract**, which then forwards the data to a **Switchboard** for verification.

Depending on the application, **Transmitters** may also be referred to as **Relayers**, **Solvers**, **Fillers**, **Provers**, or **Paymasters**.

### Key Role of Transmitters

- **Move Data Onchain:**
  Transmitters take the proof generated by a Watcher and submit it to the onchain **SOCKET contract** for validation by a **Switchboard**.

- **Coordinate with Watchers:**
  After a user signs an off-chain request, the Transmitter ensures that the corresponding proof and user request are submitted to the blockchain for execution.

- **Trigger Onchain Contracts:**
  Once the proof is verified by the Switchboard, the Transmitter facilitates the execution of the applicationâ€™s onchain smart contract.

### How Transmitters Fit into the Protocol

1. **User sends a request to the Watcher**, where the App-Gateway executes logic and generates a proof.
2. **The Watcher passes the proof to the Transmitter.**
3. **The Transmitter submits the proof and user request to the onchain SOCKET contract.**
4. **The Switchboard verifies the proof and returns a boolean.**
5. **If accepted, the onchain smart contract is triggered.**

:::info
Transmitters play a key role in ensuring that user requests and off-chain logic are securely processed and executed onchain. They serve as the critical link between off-chain operations and onchain execution.
