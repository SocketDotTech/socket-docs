title: Intent-Based Multi-Chain Execution
---

The Ethereum Improvement Proposal [(EIP) 7683](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7683) introduces a framework for "Intents", allowing users to specify desired outcomes without managing the complexities of transaction execution. By integrating this with **SOCKET Protocol**, we can create an **intent-based multi-chain system** that utilizes an [AppGateway smart contract](/writing-apps#architecture-overview) as an orchestrator to facilitate and verify transactions across multiple blockchains.

## Architecture

1. **Define User Intents**
   - Users specify high-level intents such as swapping assets across chains.
   - Example: Swap Token A on Chain X for Token B on Chain Y.

2. **AppGateway as Orchestrator**
   - The AppGateway smart contract interprets the intent and determines the optimal execution strategy.

3. **Pre-Execution Logic**
   - **Security Checks**: Ensures compliance with security standards.
   - **Auctions**: Optimizes execution costs by selecting the best available route.

4. **Execution via SOCKET Components**
   - [Watchers](/watchers): Monitor blockchain states and generate execution proofs.
   - [Transmitters](/transmitters): Submit proofs onchain to trigger execution.
   - [Switchboards](/switchboards): Validate and authorize transactions before finalization.

## Key Contract Implementations

### Opening a Cross-Chain Order via AppGateway

#### Gasless Order (User Signs, Filler Executes)
```solidity
function openGaslessOrder(
    address settlementForwarder,
    GaslessCrossChainOrder calldata order,
    bytes calldata signature,
    bytes calldata originFillerData
) external async {
    // Calls the origin settlerâ€™s openFor function
    IOriginSettler(settlementForwarder).openFor(
        order,
        signature,
        originFillerData
    );
}
```
:::note
Allows a filler to execute an order on behalf of a user.
:::

#### Onchain Order (User Directly Opens)
```solidity
function openOnchainOrder(
    address settlementForwarder,
    OnchainCrossChainOrder calldata order
) external async {
    // user calls gateway, gateway calls settler
    IOriginSettler(settlementForwarder).open(order);
}
```
:::note
Users can directly open a cross-chain order through the Application Gateway.
:::

### Deploying & Initializing the Settlement Contracts

```solidity
function deployContracts(uint32 chainSlug) external async {
    _deploy(settlementId, chainSlug);
}
```
:::note
Deploys the required contracts across multiple chains.
:::

### Resolving & Filling Orders on the Destination Chain

#### Resolving a Gasless Order
```solidity
function resolveFor(
    GaslessCrossChainOrder calldata order,
    bytes calldata originFillerData
) external view override returns (ResolvedCrossChainOrder memory) {
    bytes32 orderId = _computeOrderId(order.user, order.nonce);
    return _resolveInternalGasless(order, originFillerData, orderId);
}
```
:::note
Verifies an order before it is executed on the destination chain.
:::

#### Filling an Order (Delivering Funds to the User)
```solidity
function fill(
    bytes32 orderId,
    bytes calldata originData,
    bytes calldata fillerData
) external override {
    require(openedOrders[orderId], "Order not opened");
    require(!filledOrders[orderId], "Order already filled");

    // Execute cross-chain settlement logic...
    filledOrders[orderId] = true;
}
```
:::note
Finalizes the transaction by transferring assets to the recipient.
:::

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Simplified User Experience**: Users declare outcomes and the system handles execution.
- **Security & Verification**: Pre-execution checks ensure order validity.
- **Optimized Execution**: Auctions and best-route selection improve efficiency.
