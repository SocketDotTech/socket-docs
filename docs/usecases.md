title: Key Use Cases
---

SOCKET Protocol enables powerful applications through **chain-abstracted composability** and **pre-execution capabilities**. Here are some key use cases, though this list continues to grow as developers innovate with the protocol.

## Horizontal Scaling

Traditional blockchain scaling typically follows two vertical approaches:
- Launching an app-chain
- Deploying on high-throughput chains

However, these methods create **composability challenges**, making it difficult for applications and users on other chains/rollups to interact with your application.

SOCKET enables a different approach: **horizontal scaling**. Similar to modern web applications, your application can be deployed across multiple chains/rollups simultaneously, with traffic load-balanced between them. Using SOCKET's app-gateway, this process becomes seamless for onchain contracts. [This approach is already being utilized by several leading applications](https://x.com/vaibhavchellani/status/1859544081539690909).

## Intent-Based Execution

SOCKET allows developers to build sophisticated intent systems that improve user experience and execution efficiency. Through app-gateways, developers can:
- Process user intents
- Run execution auctions
- Optimize transaction routing

The protocol's built-in transmitters enable immediate implementation of intent-based systems while maintaining full control over security, cost, and performance.

## Application-Specific Sequencing

Applications generating MEV (Miner Extractable Value) can benefit from custom transaction sequencing. Rather than letting chain validators capture this value, developers can:
- Create app-gateways to sequence transactions
- Capture and redirect value to designated stakeholders
- Implement custom execution ordering

A notable example is Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) capture from swap transactions.

## Pre-Execution Security

Unlike traditional security services that operate post-transaction, SOCKET enables preventative security through pre-execution checks. Using app-gateways, developers can:
- Implement security validations before onchain execution
- Enforce critical protocol invariants
- Prevent potential exploits proactively

## Additional Use Cases

The protocol continues to enable new applications, including:
- Resource locking mechanisms
- Custom auction systems
- Cross-chain composability features

We welcome developers to explore these possibilities and discover new use cases. Share your ideas and implementations with the SOCKET community!
