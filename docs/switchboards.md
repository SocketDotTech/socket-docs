**Switchboards** are onchain smart contracts that validate offchain proofs generated by **Watchers** and submitted by **Transmitters**. They ensure that the offchain logic executed in the **AppGateway** meets the application's security, cost, and performance requirements.

### Key Features of Switchboards

- **Permissionless Registration:**
  Anyone can write a Switchboard and register it with the **SOCKET** protocol.

- **Lightweight Interface:**
  The interface is designed to be simple and efficient. Switchboards accept proofs from Transmitters and return a boolean (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the proof is valid.

- **Application-Defined:**
  Developers can choose or create their own Switchboards to meet their desired security, cost, and latency profiles.

- **Proof-Agnostic:**
  Switchboards accept various types of proofs, such as oracle attestations, zk-proofs, multi-signature proofs, or optimistic submissions.

### How Switchboards Fit into the Protocol

1. **The Transmitter submits a signed user request and proof** generated by a Watcher to the onchain SOCKET contract.
2. **The SOCKET contract forwards the proof to the Switchboard** selected by the application developer.
3. **The Switchboard verifies the proof** and returns a boolean (`true` or `false`).
4. **If the proof is accepted**, the onchain smart contract is executed.

Switchboards provide developers with complete control over their validation logic, allowing them to balance security, cost, and performance to suit their specific application needs.

### Think of Switchboards as...

The connective tissue between **Watchers** and application developers. They allow developers to define when offchain proofs are considered valid, ensuring that offchain logic is securely and efficiently verified before triggering onchain contracts.
