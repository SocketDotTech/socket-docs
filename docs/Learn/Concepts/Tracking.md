When plugs send a message, a `MessageOutbound` event is emitted with a `msgId`, which is a unique identifier for each message. This is generated by performing bitwise operations on the local chain ID and message count

The status of a message can be tracked using an API built by Socket. More on this in [Status Tracking API](../../Dev%20Resources/APIReference/Track.md)

Socket transmits packets from one chain to another. Messages need to get included into these packets to be delivered to the destination chain. Packets are also assigned a unique identifier `packetId`, generated from the local chain ID, capacitor address and packet count on given capacitor. 

Once a message is sent outbound, it will be included in a packet. Packets are periodically sealed by Transmitters and then proposed on the destination chain. Upon sealing, a `PacketVerifiedAndSealed` event is emitted. This has the `packetId` and can be used to track the status of the packet a message is included in.
